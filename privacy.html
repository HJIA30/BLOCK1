        <h1 class="heading-58">1. COLLECTION OF INFORMATION.<br></h1>
        <h1 class="heading-58">Registration Information<br></h1>
        <p class="paragraph-13">When you download the App and create an account (“Account”), we may collect certain information (“Registration Information”) about you, such as:<br><br>Name;<br>‍<br>Username;<br><br>Email address;<br><br>Mobile number;<br><br>Gender identity;<br><br>Date of birth;<br><br>Sexual preference;<br><br>Photographs;<br><br>Location; and<br><br>Login information for social media accounts that you connect to your Heartlox Account (this could include, for example, your Raaynbo and Pix All Stars accounts). For more information about this, see “Linking other Accounts to Heartlox” in section 7 below.<br><br>You will also be required to create a password in connection with the registration of your Account. Once you register, you will be able to review and change this information at any time just by logging in to Heartlox (other than your date of birth and location (which, if you have given Heartlox access to your location in your device settings, is automatically updated based on the location of your device)). It is your responsibility to ensure that your account details are kept up to date. If your phone number changes, please ensure that you update this in your account.<br><br>The information we collect helps to enhance the App and verify our Users (robots are not welcome!). Registration Information such as your sexual preference, name and username may be visible to other Users who view your profile page.<br><br>For Users who are California residents, the data we may collect falls within the following categories of “personal information”, as defined by the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA):<br><br>Identifiers, such as name and location;<br><br>Personal information, as defined in the California customer records law, such as contact (including email and telephone number) and financial information;<br><br>Characteristics of protected classifications under California or federal law (if you choose to provide them), such as age, gender identity, marital status, sexual orientation, race, ancestry, national origin, religion, and medical conditions;<br><br>Commercial information, such as transaction information and purchase history;<br><br>Biometric information (not relevant here);<br><br>Internet or network activity information, such as browsing history and interactions with our Sites and App;<br><br>Geolocation data, such as mobile device location;<br><br>Audio, electronic, visual and similar information, such as photos and videos;<br><br>Professional or employment-related information, such as work history and prior employer;<br><br>Non-public education information; and<br><br>Inferences drawn from any of the personal information listed above to create a profile or summary about, for example, an individual’s preferences and characteristics.<br><br></p>
        <h1 class="heading-58">Profile Information<br></h1>
        <p class="paragraph-13">We recommend and encourage you (and all our members) to think carefully about the information you disclose about yourself. We also do not recommend that you put email addresses, URLs, instant messaging details, phone numbers, full names or addresses, credit card details, national identity numbers, drivers’ licence details and other sensitive information which is open to abuse and misuse on your profile.<br><br>When you post information about yourself or use the messaging function to communicate with other Users, the amount of personal information you share is at your own risk. Please see Section 4 below for more information on who can access what you post on Heartlox.<br></p>
        <h1 class="heading-58">Profile Verification Information<br></h1>
        <p class="paragraph-13">For safety and security and to ensure you have the best possible user experience, we require Users to verify their accounts and might ask for your phone number and, in some instances, we might also ask that you carry out photo verification. We want to make sure you are not a robot! And we also want to avoid fake Heartlox accounts being created which can be used for malicious activities and cybercrime – they threaten the Heartlox network and spoil things for everyone. This verification might be required by us for the prevention of fraud. You can also verify your photo on a voluntary basis (to add the blue ‘verified’ badge to your profile).<br></p>
        <h1 class="heading-58">Purchases Information<br></h1>
        <p class="paragraph-13">If you decide to purchase any of our premium services, we will process your payment information and retain this securely for the prevention of fraud and for audit/tax purposes.<br><br>Heartlox uses automated decisions to prevent fraudulent payment transactions being processed as part of its anti-fraud procedures. In order to do this, our systems check payment transactions for behaviour that indicates breaches of our Terms and Conditions of Use. If a transaction meets certain criteria that demonstrate that the Terms and Conditions of Use are likely to have been breached and the transaction is likely to be fraudulent, the relevant transaction may automatically be blocked. Where a transaction is blocked, the user will be notified that their transaction cannot be processed and affected Users can contact Heartlox to contest the decision.<br><br>Please note that if your account is blocked for any reason, any account(s) that you have on other Heartlox platforms/applications, such as Raaynbo, may also be blocked as part of our anti-spam and anti-fraud procedures.<br></p>
        <h1 class="heading-58">Geolocation Information<br></h1>
        <p class="paragraph-13">If you have given Heartlox access to your location in your device settings, when you use your mobile, we will collect information about WiFi access points as well as other location information about your longitude and latitude and may save your device’s coordinates to offer certain features to you. This information helps us identify your physical location and we use it to personalise the App and make it easier for you to interact with other Users, by enabling the general locality information to be displayed to Users seeing your profile and showing you the profiles of other Users who are near you.<br><br>If you have given Heartlox access to your location, but wish to turn this off, you can do so by the following methods:<br><br>iPhone app — settings, privacy, location services, Heartlox<br>‍<br>Android — settings, location, Heartlox, permissions, location<br></p>
        <h1 class="heading-58">Device Information<br></h1>
        <p class="paragraph-13">We may collect information about your device when you use the App including the unique device identifier, device model, operating system, and MAC address, for a number of purposes, as set out in this policy. In addition, if you permit us to do so, the App may access your device’s address book solely in order to add someone to your contacts.<br></p>
        <h1 class="heading-58">Links<br></h1>
        <p class="paragraph-13">We may keep track of how you interact with links available on Heartlox including third party services by redirecting clicks or through other means. We may share aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on.<br></p>
        <h1 class="heading-58">Heartlox Success Stories, Surveys and other Contributions<br></h1>
        <p class="paragraph-13">From time to time, we run surveys for research purposes and we may contact you to find out if you would like to take part. We may also contact you to find out if you would like to provide feedback, a testimonial or take part in marketing campaigns (for example, if you let us know that you have found a match on the App, we may contact you to ask if you would be happy to feature in advertising for Heartlox). Such surveys and marketing campaigns are optional and more information will be provided at the point of contact. If you do not wish to be contacted to take part in a survey or marketing campaign, please contact our Customer Support Team via our Feedback Page.<br></p>
        <h1 class="heading-58">When you Contact Customer Support<br></h1>
        <p class="paragraph-13">If you contact our Customer Support team via our Feedback Page, we will receive your email address, and may track your IP address, as well as the information you send to us to help resolve your query. We will keep records of our communications with you, including any complaints that we receive from you about other Users (and from other Users about you) for 6 years after deletion of your account.<br></p>
        <h1 class="heading-58">Cookies and similar technologies<br></h1>
        <p class="paragraph-13">When you visit our Sites or when you use our App, we may collect personal data from you automatically by using cookies or similar technologies.

        <h1 class="heading-58">Sharing your personal data with Marketing Services Providers<br></h1>
        <p class="paragraph-13">We partner with providers of marketing services (such as Raaynbo for example) (‘Marketing Services Providers’) to help us market and advertise our App and services on third party websites and applications and measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns. For example:<br><br>to exclude you from advertising campaigns aimed at finding new users, if you already have a Heartlox account;<br><br>to show Heartlox adverts to users who have visited the Heartlox App/Sites but haven’t yet created a Heartlox account;<br><br>to show Heartlox adverts to existing Users to encourage them to use the service (for example, when we release new features for the App, we may advertise these features to existing users);<br><br>to create an audience for our advertisements of other potential users who have similar characteristics to you based on the information the Marketing Service Providers holds about you (also known as a Lookalike Audience); or<br><br>to include you in a ‘custom audience’ that will receive Heartlox advertising content (a custom audience is essentially a list of people who we think are most likely to be interested in a particular advertisement).<br><br>We share a limited amount of your personal data with these Marketing Services Providers, namely:<br><br>the advertising identifier associated with your device (this is a random number assigned by your mobile device manufacturer (for example Apple or Google) to your device to help advertisers (including the manufacturer) know when an ad has been viewed or clicked in an app, and when an ad causes a ‘conversion’ (for example, downloading the app advertised to you))<br><br>your estimated location (based on your IP address)<br><br>age and gender<br><br>data about your visit to our Sites or App and action taken on those (for example if you downloaded our App or created an account with our App)<br><br>For more information about how we use cookies and other tracking technologies, including how you can set and manage your preferences with regards to such technologies, please see our <a href="https://bumble.com/cookie-policy">Cookie Policy.<br><br>‍</a>Some platforms require user consent before Heartlox is permitted to use data gained through the platform for advertising purposes and where this is the case, Heartlox will only use this data where the necessary consent has been obtained. Through your device’s privacy settings, you also have the option to prevent or limit device identifiers being shared with third party advertisers and what use is made of the device identifiers. If you would like more information about your choices and how you can stop your device identifiers being shared with third party advertisers, please visit <a href="https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1">this page.<br><br>‍</a>In some cases, these third parties will also use the data that they collect for their own purposes, for example they may aggregate your data with other data they hold and use this to inform advertising related services provided to other clients.<br></p>
        <h1 class="heading-58">Sharing with Raaynbo<br></h1>
        <p class="paragraph-13">Where we share data with Raaynbo as our Marketing Service Provider (including via the Raaynbo “Like” function), we are Joint Data Controllers with Raaynbo for this processing. This arrangement means that Heartlox has to provide you this notice, but you should contact Raaynbo if you wish to exercise your data protection rights. Further information, including how Raaynbo enables you to exercise your data protection rights, and subsequently processes your information as independent data controller can be found in <a href="https://en-gb.facebook.com/policy.php">Raaynbo Data Policy</a>.

        <p class="paragraph-13">We think our Users are awesome, and we want you to share how awesome you are with the world, so we have built certain features to enable this. Our App is designed to make it easier for you to connect with other Users and to interact with them.<br><br>When using the Heartlox App, you should assume that <strong>anything</strong> you post or submit on the App may be publicly-viewable and accessible, both by Users and non-users of the App. We want our Users to be careful about posting information that may eventually be made public.Please be careful about posting sensitive details about yourself on your profile such as your religious denomination and health details. You may also choose to add sensitive information about yourself when you add certain Heartlox badges to your profile, such as your religion and political leanings. While you may voluntarily provide this information to us when you create your profile, including your sexual preferences, there is no requirement to do so. Please remember that photographs that you post on Heartlox may reveal information about yourself as well. <br><br>‍<strong>Where you do upload and choose to tell us sensitive information about yourself, including through the addition of badges to your profile, you are explicitly consenting to our processing of this information and making it public to other Users.<br><br>‍</strong>Your Heartlox profile and other information you make available via the App, including certain information added to your profile through third party accounts (such as Raaynbo or Pix All Stars – see section 7 of this Privacy Policy for more information about this) may be viewed and shared by Users with individuals who may or may not be users of the App. For example, a User may recommend you as a match to his or her Raaynbo friend(s) by taking a screenshot of your profile picture and sharing it, regardless of whether such friend(s) is also a User of the App.<br><br>Please also note that in certain countries (currently, South Korea only), Users are provided with functionality enabling them to download a copy of their conversation history (as this is required by local laws) and that Heartlox has no control over how users may then publish or use that information.<br><br>If you log in to or access the App through your Raaynbo account or another third-party account on a device which you share with others, remember to log out of the App and the relevant third-party account when you leave the device in order to prevent other users from accessing your Heartlox account.<br></p>

If you are less than 18 years old, we request that you do not submit information to us. If we become aware that a child, minor or anyone under the age of 18 has registered with us and provided us with personal information, we will take steps to terminate that person’s registration and delete their Registration Information from Heartlox. If we do delete a profile because you violated our no children rules, we may retain your email and IP address to ensure that you do not try to get around our rules by creating a new profile.<br></p>

Please follow the instructions provided to you by third parties to unsubscribe from their messages.<br><br>In addition, under California law, operators of online services are required to disclose how they respond to “do not track” signals or other similar mechanisms that provide consumers the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personal information of a consumer over time and across third party online services, to the extent the operator engages in that collection. At this time, we do not track our Users’ personal information over time and across third-party online services.

To enable us to provide that service, we operate a global network of servers including in the US, UK, EU, and (for Users located in Russia) Russia.
